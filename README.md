# Following-ToyMCJetTutorial

This is a basic example of a GitHub repository, created (as prompted by the tutorial at https://github.com/smeehan12/ToyMCJetsTutorial/blob/master/Note/ToyMCJetTutorial.pdf) to instill best practices for working with code. All .ipynb files included in this repo are attempts at the coding exercises presented in the same doc.
